### Introduction

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction is an essential task for banks aiming to optimize customer retention and maximize profitability. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost, financial institutions can predict the likelihood of customer churn and assess the long-term value each customer brings to the bank. This enables more targeted marketing strategies and resource allocation, ultimately driving growth and improving customer satisfaction. The example provided demonstrates the process of predicting CLV using Random Forest and XGBoost on a sample dataset, illustrating how these models can be applied effectively in the banking sector.

### Data

The dataset used in this project was provided by Wharton Customer Analytics, in conjunction with partner companies. This is a real data sets provided for educational purposes. I am not able to put the datasets used in these assignments into this repository as that would be a breach of the Data User Agreement I've signed. The dataset contains apple product reviews with six fields: Review_ID, Item_ID, Review_date, Content Rating, and Helpful_votes.
